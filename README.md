# 10 OpenTofu best practices for Naver Cloud Platform

The talk starts with live demos that show how OpenTofu works in action and how to use Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) to manage your [NCloud](https://www.ncloud.com/) (demos: [1](demo_1_github/) and [2](demo_2_ncloud/)). Next, we review ten recommendations for your IaC projects with OpenTofu and Terraform. Following the recommendations will help you to level up the IaC in your organization. 

In the last demo ‚Äî [NCloud & TACOS](demo_4_tacos/) ‚Äî we show the benefits of running your OpenTofu and Terraform with an infrastructure orchestrator/[T(O)ACOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MLBpBqZmpM) ‚Äî [Spacelift](https://spacelift.io/how-it-works).

The talk aims to provide practical hints to help you start well, scale your IaC project later, and run alongside your Kubernetes environment.

In the repository, you will find:
